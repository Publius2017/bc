# The Bedrock Coalition: Recentering American Politics #

>To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the whole is indispensable.... 

>All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests.

>However combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.

--- George Washington, [Farewell Address, September 1796](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp)

>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  
 Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,  
 The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere  
 The ceremony of innocence is drowned;  
 The best lack all conviction, while the worst  
 Are full of passionate intensity.
 
--- William Butler Yeats, [The Second Coming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Coming_%28poem%29)

WHEREAS:

- The 2016 elections in the United States and subsequent events have threatened American democracy

- Our main political parties and key elected officials have gained unsavory and untrustworthy reputations:

    - the Democratic Party as a bunch of weak socialist liberals who want a more intrusive and more expensive government and who are out of touch with American social values
    - the Republican Party as a bunch of greedy rabid wolves supporting individual achievement at the expense of the less fortunate, and providing a haven for various groups such as white supremacists, Wall Street tycoons, the religious right, climate change deniers, NRA fanatics, and so on
    - the President-Elect as a narcissistic bully, spouting empty rhetoric and innuendo, with no experience holding public office, exemplifying the extreme elements of the Republican Party
    
- Partisan politics in the United States has had undue negative effects on the interests of this nation
    - by polarizing the electorate and the government towards two competing extremes
    - by wasting countless billions of dollars and man-hours that could be better spent in pursuing vital interests of this nation
    - by wasting the limited number of hours available for discussion on the House and Senate floors; spending this time on partisan politics means even less time to accomplish useful debate and legislation

- Large shifts in political power can be produced by very small changes in voting outcome
    - One party may have 49 members of the Senate, and the other 51 --- a very slim majority, but that is enough to control the rules and agenda
    - The Electoral College in all states but Maine and Nebraska is a winner-take-all contest, so that, again, a very slight plurality can cause a large gain for the winner
    - This provides a very high motivation for fraud, gerrymandering, and disenfranchisement in order to seize power

- Candidates from third parties such as the Libertarian or Green Party have essentially no voice in Congress, and no chance at achieving the Presidency, only the ability to rob a small fraction of votes from one or the other party during elections

- An increasing plurality of Americans consider themselves as Independent rather than Democratic or Republican [1] ... and yet this is not mirrored in Congress

- We cannot expect either Republican or Democratic Party to be more constructive and respectable on their own

THEREFORE:

Something must be done to reduce the extent and impact of partisan politics in American government.

The parties themselves do not encourage bipartisanship, centrism, or deviation from the party platforms, and several aspects of the American political system give leverage to whichever of the two parties has the slightest advantage, leading to a maintain-power-at-all-cost philosophy that has eroded some of the American ideals of fairness and equality.

Let us suppose the existence of a Bedrock Coalition --- the name intended to remind us that government is supported by, and gains its power from, a stable foundation --- with the following mission:

- To encourage bipartisanship
- To identify, propose, and promote important positions on issues which a strong majority (at least 2/3) of the voting public can support
- To take no position on issues which are divisive, leaving those for the parties to determine through their usual actions: at best to engage in constructive dialogue, and at worst to squabble over
- To prevent rules and laws which provide artificial and unfair political bias in elections
- To provide verbal support for any candidates (even if more than one is running for the same office) who share these goals
- To educate the general public to reach a fair and unbiased opinion
- To put the political parties on notice that a winner-take-all attitude of governance is no longer acceptable; that whatever the makeup of government, whether a strong majority or a weak plurality, elected officials are responsible for service to their entire constituency, not just the voters who have elected them

Such an organization would not be a political party, but rather a nonpartisan group acting as a counterweight to the excess of partisan political action committees. There are many issues such as increasing the minimum wage [2], protecting the environment [3], and allowing undocumented immigrants to stay in the US [3], where not only a majority but a large majority of voters agree on positions, despite the rhetoric coming out of the different parties.

Many partisan actions artificially and insidiously attempt to maintain political power at the cost of democracy. These include:

- Redistricting that is specifically intended to benefit the controlling party
- Voter ID laws that place an unfair burden on the poor
- State ballot laws that list candidates by party, in order of the share of votes that party received in a recent election, for example in states such as Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin, which determine ballot order by party votes received for the preceding gubernatorial election

These should be abolished so that elections are fair. When the election process is twisted, even slightly, in such a way to benefit a political party, the entire electorate loses.

The only way to counteract this harmful polarization, this useless gridlock, this damaging tug-of-war between Republicans and Democrats, is for a significant fraction of the American voting public to pull in a different direction, and the only direction that is likely to gain sufficient support is toward the center. If a substantial number of committed American voters, regardless of whether they lean Republican or Democratic or can't decide, can say

- I want my elected officials to serve *all* their constituents, not just the ones who voted for them
- I want my elected officials to stop pandering to a handful of vocal extremists and lobbyists
- I want my elected officials to pursue bipartisan legislation that suits their constituency
- I want my elected officials to act the way they think is right, not just by following the commands of their party

then perhaps we can break the gridlock and start making some useful progress in this country.

One key hurdle to making a difference in American politics, of course, is money, and it is nearly impossible to outweigh the Super PACs that pull away from the center and towards the extremes. Yet the 2016 campaign has showed that grass-roots enthusiasm can accomplish great things in aggregate: the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders had raised $209 million through April 2016, almost two-thirds of it in small contributions of less than $200. [4] While Sanders is not a centrist, he appealed to large crowds of people by bucking the trend of the candidate who follows the party machines. A large and enthusiastic group of citizens can not only pull towards the center in their intentions, but can provide significant financial support, when they see an attempt to represent them fairly and honestly.

George Washington warned about the dangers of partisan politics over two hundred years ago, and we must follow his wise and prescient leadership.

IN SUMMARY:

- Partisan politics is wasteful and harmful to democracy in the United States
- The Republican Party and Democratic Party are not going to fix this on their own
- The only major segment of the electorate capable of defeating party politics is the center
- An organized coalition working to get civic-minded Americans and their elected representatives to pull towards the center is not only a possibility, but a vital strategy in counteracting party extremism
- We must start this process right away!
